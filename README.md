In order to choose the keyframes from a video sequence that best convey its information, our
project on keyframe extraction offers a unique method that blends autoencoder-based feature
extraction with nested k-means clustering. Keyframe selection and extraction from videos is a
crucial operation since it may assist to drastically minimise the amount of data that has to be
processed or preserved and enables viewers to get a broad idea of the content without having
to watch the full sequence. Our suggested technique makes use of a variational autoencoder
(VAE), a form of autoencoder that has a probabilistic model that makes feature extraction
more efficient and dependable. Because VAEs can more correctly capture the distribution of
the data, which results in more accurate feature extraction, they are regarded to be an
improvement over typical autoencoders. In order to find the most representative frames or
keyframes, the VAE-based feature extraction approach is utilised to extract significant
characteristics from the video frames. The suggested technique makes use of nested k-means
clustering to determine which frames or keyframes are the most representative. The layered
clustering technique enables the selection of keyframes that are more indicative of the
particular video features in which the viewer is interested. It also allows for finer-grained
grouping discoveries. This method makes keyframe extraction more accurate and efficient,
which is especially helpful for applications like video summary, retrieval, and indexing. The
effectiveness of the suggested technique on different datasets is demonstrated by experimental
findings. The suggested approach fared better than common keyframe extraction methods that
depend on heuristics and threshold-based methods, which can be brittle and produce
less-than-ideal results. The suggested technique is a flexible and efficient way to extract
keyframes from films since it makes use of VAE-based feature extraction and nested k-means
clustering to capture complex correlations and patterns in video frames and choose frames that
best depict the video content.
